- Hyperparameter tuning
-- max_depth optimal found at 3
-- max_depth 2 has poor performance
-- any max_depth past 3 tends to go towards overfitting
-- min samples to split seems like it has little to no effect on model performance, so it was ommitted
-- min samples leaf has a large effect on model performance, almost as much as max_depth and especially when in combination with max_depth
-- the combination of increasing max_depth and min_samples_leaf at the same time leads to a more complex and robust model that performs better


--Feature selection
- Feature selection was done using improtance rankings given by the decision tree
- Any feature contributing more than 1% was used. All other features were discarded
